## Description

This script applies a slide-in effect on scroll on images on a website. It detects the image position and slides the image in when the image is half scrolled in. Assembling this code helped me:

<li>Practice writing JS code, namely event listeners, query selectors and functions.</li>
<li>Learn about Debouncing Functions on scroll events which can I'm prove page performance. </li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow.</li><br>
